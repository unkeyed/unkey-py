# GroupBy

By default, datapoints are not aggregated, however you probably want to get a breakdown per time, key or identity.

Grouping by tags and by tag is mutually exclusive.


## Supported Types

### `models.One`

```python
value: models.One = /* values here */
```

### `List[models.QueryParam2]`

```python
value: List[models.QueryParam2] = /* values here */
```
